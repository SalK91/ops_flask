# Intro to Flask with Tensorflow Lite

- Build a simple app base on Tensorflow Lite model from
https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/TensorFlow%20Deployment/Course%202%20-%20TensorFlow%20Lite/Week%202/Exercise/TFLite_Week2_Exercise.ipynb
 

- The frontend should look as below if you deploy the app correctly:
![initial](static/images/initial.png)

- And if you wrote the inference function right and render the result template correctly, the output should look as below:
![prediction](static/images/prediction.png)

- _Make sure you use an image from the test_images folder to test your app_.
